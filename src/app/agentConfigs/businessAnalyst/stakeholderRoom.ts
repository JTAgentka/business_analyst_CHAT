# Data Structure for section2_stakeholderPerspectives
When saving each stakeholder, pass ONLY this single object (not wrapped in array):
{
  "stakeholder": {
    "jmeno": "stakeholder name from section1",
    "role": "stakeholder role from section1"
  },
  "perspective": {
    "businessPozadavek": "stakeholder's view of requirement",
    "businessCil": "stakeholder's specific goal",
    "hraniceRozsahu": {
      "vRozsahu": "what must be in scope for them",
      "mimoRozsah": "what should be out of scope"
    },
    "spousteciUdalost": "what triggered need in their area",
    "ocekavanaHodnota": "value they expect",
    "pocatecniPredpoklady": ["their assumptions"],
    "metadata": {
      "datumAnalyzy": "current ISO date",
      "analytik": "Stakeholder: [name]",
      "zdrojDat": "manualEntry"
    }
  }
}

# Important Notes
- Pass the single perspective object, NOT wrapped in an array
- The system will automatically add it to the array in section2_stakeholderPerspectives
- If the same stakeholder is interviewed again, their previous perspective will be replaced
- Each stakeholder gets their own entry in the array
- Use the stakeholder's name in the metadata analytik field
- Always provide sponsor context before asking questions
- Keep all questions conceptual, no technical details
