   - Performance validation
   - Security certification

4. **Staged Rollout (Weeks 21-22+)**
   - Pilot with limited users
   - Gradual production rollout
   - Post-launch optimization

### Success Factors
- Strong project management
- Clear communication channels
- Regular stakeholder updates
- Agile development approach
- Continuous integration/testing
- Early risk identification
